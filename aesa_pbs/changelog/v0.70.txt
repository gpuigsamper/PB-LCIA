2020-07-21: Updates from v0.6.5 to v0.7.0

1a) ########Biogeochemical flows - P #####
The following elementary flows are now taken into account:
Phosphate, (CF = 2.81E-10)
Poshosphorous, total, (8.61E-10)
Poshosphorous,  (8.61E-10)

Emission to Lake and River are now considered.
In the v0.65 only Pshosphorous,  (8.61E-10) to Lake was considered

1b) ########Biogeochemical flows - N #####
The following elementary flows are now taken into account:
Nitrate, (CF = 5.51E-9)
Nitrogen, (CF = 2.44E-8)
Nitrogen, total, (CF = 2.44E-8)

Emission to Lake and River are now considered.
In v0.65 only Nitrate,  (5.51E-9) to Lake/River was considered

2) ############ Damage assessment (% of BII loss) ############
At updated from 1.08 to 1.30 E+14 m2
In 0.65 the Earth’s total Area considered was 1.08E+14 m2, according to ReCiPe2016,
In this version the total area is consistent with IMAGE model 
(https://models.pbl.nl/image/index.php/Download_packages)

Mean Species Abundance (MSA) is used as a proxy of Biological Intactness Index (BII)
“The main difference between MSA and BII is that every hectare is given equal weight in MSA, 
whereas BII gives more weight to species rich areas.” (Alkemade et al. 2009)

GWP    [kg CO2 eq]    = Global Warming Potential  
                        (calculated using ""ReCiPe 2016 (H) midpoint"" characterization factors)
BF_LU  [BII loss*m2a] = Biological footprint for Land Use
BF_CC [BII loss*m2a]  = Biological footprint for Climate Change
At        [m2yr]      = Earth’s total land (used in 1 yr) = 1.30E+14 
MSA                   = Mean species abundance  
                        (from 0: no species; to 1: undisturbed biodevirsity)
(1-MSA)               = Loss of mean species aboundance  
                        (from 0: no loss of species; to 1: complete loss of species)

(Hanafiah et al. 2012) provides (1-MSA) values for diffent land types present in SimaPro.
(1-MSA) values are used as the characterization factors to assess ""Biological footprint, LU"". 
(1-MSA) values are applied to land use inventory flows (m2a).

BF_LU is calculated as SUM[Ai*(1-MSAi)] for ""i-th"" land use types

According to (Hanafiah et al. 2012), BF_CC can be calculated as follows:
BF_CC = 0.27 * kg CO2 

""In damage assessment""
BII loss is finally calculated as:
% BII loss = 100 x (BF_LU+GWP*0.27)/At

The factor applied to GWP is calculated as 100 x (0.27/At) = 2.07692E-13
the factor applied to BF_LU is calculated as 100 x (1/At)     = 7.69231E-13

NOTE: Indicators with the prefix ""(not PBs)"" are used exclusively for the damage assessment, 
where the final indicator is provided.
